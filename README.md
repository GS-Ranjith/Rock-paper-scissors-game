## 🚀 Project Overview

This game allows a user to play **Rock–Paper–Scissors** against the computer in the terminal.

* The game runs for **10 rounds**
* The computer makes random choices
* Scores are tracked for **user wins**, **computer wins**, and **ties**
* Final results are displayed at the end

This project is beginner-friendly and perfect for practicing Python fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* Built-in modules:

  * `random`

No external libraries are required.
